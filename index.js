This is a very basic autobuilding index.html generator. 
It simply takes a list of filenames in the current directory, sorts them alphabetically, and writes an index.html file that contains links to all the files in the directory.
import os import glob def build_index(): """Build an index.html file for the current directory."""
# Get a list of all files in the current directory filenames = glob.glob('*') 
# Sort them alphabetically filenames = sorted(filenames) 
# Open index.  html for writing f = open('index.htm', 'w') 
# Write the header f.write(""" <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> """) # Write links to all the files 
for filename in filenames: f.
